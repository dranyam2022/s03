    <p>
        The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of abstraction.
        The clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the
        way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and
        tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high-sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and
        the details form a cohesive code.
